1NF:
Make each rows of the table unique (make a special column for them and set as primary key)



2NF:
Separate repeating columns and non-repeating columns, then remove partial dependencies.
                                                             (this is where you form foreign keys out of them and set those foreign keys as primary keys on a separate table.)


3NF:
 
    Remove transitive dependencies (tables must contain columns that depend only on its primary key, not on another column also)
